#' Creates a set of targets for a landscape class
#'
#' @description Creates a set of targets for a landscape class, which can be
#' converted into JSON for flsgen.
#'
#' @details Note that NP and AREA targets can be set as NULL, if the class
#' targets is used within the `generate_series` function to generate landscape
#' series with varying NP and/or AREA. However, flsgen won't run is NP and
#' AREA are not set elsewhere.
#'
#' @param class_name Name of the class
#' @param NP number of patches target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param AREA patch area target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param AREA_MN mean patch area target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param CA total class area target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param PLAND proportion of landscape target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param PD patch density target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param SPI smallest patch index target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param LPI largest patch index target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param MESH effective mesh size target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param SPLI splitting index target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param NPRO net product target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param SDEN splitting density target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param COHE degree of coherence target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param DIVI degree of landscape division target (must be a vector of length 2)
#' @param IS_SQUARE if TRUE, the class is required to only produce square patches
#'
#' @return A class targets object which can be converted to JSON for flsgen
